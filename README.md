Project Title
Solar Energy Forecasting Using Machine Learning Techniques for Enhanced Grid Stability

Week 1 Goals
Organize all provided datasets (generation & weather data for Plant 1 and Plant 2)

Import data into Jupyter Notebook

Preview and understand basic data structure

Clean data by removing missing values

Save the cleaned datasets

Upload Jupyter notebook and organized data folder to GitHub

Week 1 Steps
Created a clear folder structure in data/plant1 and data/plant2 for all datasets.

Loaded each CSV file into Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebook.

Previewed data with .head() to check structure and standard columns.

Checked for and removed missing values using .isnull().sum() and .dropna().

Saved cleaned datasets with new filenames for reproducibility.

Documented work and uploaded everything to GitHub for version control.

Week 2 README (Copy-Paste Version)
Week 2 Goals
Fit cleaned data to a machine learning model (Linear Regression)

Split dataset into training and test groups

Train the model on training data

Predict outcomes on test data

Compare predictions with actual values

Check model accuracy using appropriate metrics

Display graphical representation of results

Upload updated notebook to GitHub

Week 2 Steps
Imported scikit-learn and matplotlib packages for modeling and visualization.

Selected relevant features (input columns) and target column from the cleaned data.

Used train_test_split to divide data into training and testing sets.

Built and trained a linear regression model using training data.

Predicted results for the test set and compared predictions to actual values.

Evaluated model performance with metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R² score.

Created a scatter plot to visually compare predicted and actual values.

Added Markdown summaries and comments in the notebook at each stage.

Saved the updated notebook and uploaded it to GitHub to document Week 2 progress.
